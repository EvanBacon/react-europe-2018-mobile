The conference aims to give talks that inspire and explore new futuristic ideas dealing with all the techs we enjoy from the React ecosystem such as **React.js, React Native, GraphQL, Relay, Universal apps, ReasonML, Webpack, inline CSS and more**.\n\nReactEurope is also a great occasion to socialize, meet new people and old friends, hack together, taste delicious food and have fun in the beautiful city of Paris.\n\n**Join us at ReactEurope Conf to shape the future of client-side, mobile and universal applications!**",

We'll break down the modular architecture of the client and teach you how to customize your own network interface through Apollo Link. We'll also dive into server-side rendering and building query components with React Apollo. Throughout the course of the workshop, you'll learn practical tips for using GraphQL in production from the engineers at Formidable Labs.\n\nThis workshop assumes participants have basic knowledge of GraphQL and intermediate knowledge of React.",

I'll talk about how we drew on 2D physics to make the confetti feel real.\n\nMake no mistake; while this talk straddles the line between engineering and UX design, this is very much a React talk.

In his talk will to highlight the differences between three possible approaches of building interactable components. He will also  show where it makes sense to design pure JS APIs (for customizability ease) and where it is needed for platform native mechanisms to be used.

But runtime type systems can do many more things than just data validation.\nBecause they are very flexible (as you can basically reuse the entire hosting language to express your types) it will be much less likely that you will run into structures that cannot be expressed in the type system. You can generate runtime types on the fly from other sources (json-schema, graphql etc) or compose them together.\n\nIn this talk I will walk you through some runtime type systems, like prop-types, tcomb and mobx-state-tree. But also show you how runtime- and compile-time typesystems like TypeScript or Flow can co-exist and leverage each other.\n\nIf you thought so far Higher Order Components or render callbacks where cool, in this talk I will show you that these patterns can be applied in general to any datastructure you have.",

I quickly figured out that it was a bot job and I started to look for a solution to do it. I found tons of projects but none of them matched my needs, so I decided to create my library.\n\nI called it SVGR. The goal was simple, transforming a SVG into a React component. I coded it and I solved my problem, I saved a lot of time! I wanted to make it open source so I took the time to make a \"beautiful\" logo with a lion emoji and a good README. I also integrated Prettier in the project, I wanted to have a nice React code output out of the box. I tweeted it and got 40 stars and one contribution, I was happy.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Christopher Chedeau tweeted about my library, two hours later React Europe also tweeted it, later that day I got a star from Dan Abramov. Next thing you know I was trending on GitHub, getting 1K stars in one day!\n\nWhat is the future for SVGR?",

You'll also be exposed to some advanced backend topics such as schema stitching.\n\nNext, we'll connect our GraphQL server to a React application with Apollo Client. We'll break down the modular architecture of the client and teach you how to customize your own network interface through Apollo Link. We'll also dive into server-side rendering and building query components with React Apollo. Throughout the course of the workshop, you'll learn practical tips for using GraphQL in production from the engineers at Formidable Labs.\n\nThis workshop assumes participants have basic knowledge of GraphQL and intermediate knowledge of React.",

You can generate runtime types on the fly from other sources (json-schema, graphql etc) or compose them together.\n\nIn this talk I will walk you through some runtime type systems, like prop-types, tcomb and mobx-state-tree. But also show you how runtime- and compile-time typesystems like TypeScript or Flow can co-exist and leverage each other.\n\nIf you thought so far Higher Order Components or render callbacks where cool, in this talk I will show you that these patterns can be applied in general to any datastructure you have.",

I quickly figured out that it was a bot job and I started to look for a solution to do it. I found tons of projects but none of them matched my needs, so I decided to create my library.\n\nI called it SVGR. The goal was simple, transforming a SVG into a React component. I coded it and I solved my problem, I saved a lot of time! I wanted to make it open source so I took the time to make a \"beautiful\" logo with a lion emoji and a good README. I also integrated Prettier in the project, I wanted to have a nice React code output out of the box. I tweeted it and got 40 stars and one contribution, I was happy.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Christopher Chedeau tweeted about my library, two hours later React Europe also tweeted it, later that day I got a star from Dan Abramov. Next thing you know I was trending on GitHub, getting 1K stars in one day!\n\nWhat is the future for SVGR?",

What if we could build a design tool based on these principles, allowing us to design flexible, composable component systems?
