Rails 6 will start making Rails scalable by default with parallel testing and improved support for using multiple databases.

In this talk we'll take a look why these improvements are important, how they work, and ways in which small ideas can quickly snowball into major changes. This is just the beginning of Rails 6.",

What evolved from this was a 100% Ruby stack, from the layer that interacts with the user's web browser to load balancing of requests to the application back ends, that was all written in Ruby.\n\nIt was fast (really, even in the Ruby 1.8 days), stable, capable, and extensible, and has evolved in use on production web sites for 10 years.\n\nWe'll look a little at the components involved, why it was done this way, and some practical lessons for modern web sites.",

Event sourcing is a pattern that stores changes to state as a sequence of events. The events encapsulate all the information needed for a record to change from one state to another, and the current state can be completely destroyed and rebuilt by replaying these events. Sounds great, right? But how do we take a system that is not designed using event sourcing, and start to apply some of these patterns? I‚Äôll give an overview of the architecture‚Äôs key components and share some examples of how to adopt event sourcing into an existing application.",

We don‚Äôt care until we found ourselves wasting too much time waiting for the green light.\n\nWhat makes tests slow and how to heal them? Let‚Äôs answer these questions.\n\nI would like to start the talk by answering several questions, e.g., ‚ÄúDo you write tests?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow long does your test suite run?‚Äù, etc. Some stats & charts.\n\nIn the first part of the I would like to share a few real-life stories: ‚ÄúOur tests were slow, we did some investigation, and the reason was X.‚Äù Most of these reasons are related to incorrect environment configuration for tests.\n\nThe second part of the talk is answering the question: how to find bottlenecks in your tests?\n\nI'm going to introduce the tool called TestProf‚Äìa toolbox for profiling test suites and a set of ready-made recipes to write faster tests and fix your existing slow codebase.\n\nLet's make tests faster!",

Sounds great, right? But how do we take a system that is not designed using event sourcing, and start to apply some of these patterns?
